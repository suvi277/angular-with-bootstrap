# angular-with-bootstrap
 Simple Angular 7 application and style components using Bootstrap 4


## Quick Start ##

Clone following repo:
git clone https://github.com/suvi277/angular-with-bootstrap.git.

Run npm i
Run npm start
Voilà! Open browser and visit http://localhost:4200

## Disclaimer ##
*Mobile menu is a swipe right menu (jQuery – click)*

Since jquery click on Menu is already handled by bootstrap, so the swipe right animatation, I handled by CSS transition.
